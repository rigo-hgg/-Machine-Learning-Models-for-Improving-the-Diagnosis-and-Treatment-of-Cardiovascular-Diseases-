The aim of the project was to improve the early diagnosis and detection of cardiovascular diseases through the use of AI, focusing on the prediction of the
likelihood of either developing cardiovascular events (such as strokes) or being at high cardiovascular risk in the future, in a cohort of mostly healthy subjects.
The data set analyzed was generated by the longitudinal PLIC study (University of Milano, Italy), which focused on the metabolic syndrome
(MetS) and on the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery as a subclinical marker of cardiovascular disease. The PLIC study followed-up 1445 patients who completed four visits over a period of 16 years. The data set that
was made available by UniMI for this work includes data in tabular format collected at each visit (personal and familiar anamnesis, lifestyle habits, clinical
parameters, drug therapies, lipid, and glycemic profiles).
On tabular data with clinical and lab test information machine learning (ML) algorithms has been applied using as predictors the variables recorded during the first visit and as targets two clinical indicators of cardiovascular risk
recorded during the last visit: 
- SCORE (percentage probability of incurring fatal cardiovascular events)
- presence of a carotid plaque (defined for IMT >1.3 mm)
